# Privacy Policy for GraphQeLves

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

GraphQeLves is a Chrome DevTools extension for inspecting GraphQL network requests. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Collection

**GraphQeLves does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

- No personal information is collected
- No analytics or tracking
- No data is sent to external servers
- No cookies are used

## Data Storage

All data processed by GraphQeLves remains entirely local to your browser:

- **Network request data** is captured only within your active DevTools session
- **Clipboard operations** occur only when you explicitly click "Copy" buttons
- **Local storage** is used solely for UI preferences (column visibility settings)
- When you close DevTools, captured request data is discarded

## Permissions Explained

GraphQeLves requires minimal permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `clipboardWrite` | Allows copying queries, variables, cURL commands, and JSON to your clipboard when you click copy buttons |
| `storage` | Saves your UI preferences (like column visibility) locally in your browser |

## Third-Party Services

GraphQeLves does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Data Security

Since no data leaves your browser, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information through our extension.
